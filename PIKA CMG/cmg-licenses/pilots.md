# Pilots

## License Cost: <mark style="color:blue;">Â£2,500,000</mark>

### Requirements for pilots license:

To be able to use the pilots license, you need to own the <mark style="color:purple;">**premium rank**</mark>**, at the minimum to gain access to be able to use the vip helicopter garages around the map which are marked as orange or green helicopter icons. I have marked two just for refrence. You can buy helicopters / car heli copters off of players and also planes, you can also purchase these via the cmg store website that you can find in "**[**Welcome to CMG**](../welcome-to-cmg.md)**" and then finding the "**[**custom imports**](../welcome-to-cmg.md)**", and there will be a list there.**
